# common_utils

This repository contains the common_utils module used for my Calibre plugins.

All this work is is highly based on the [work of kiwidude](https://github.com/kiwidude68/calibre_plugins/tree/main/common).

This module repository was created for my personal comfort and rearranged in a format I like.

```
git submodule add --name common_utils https://github.com/un-pogaz/common_utils.git
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote --merge --single-branch
```
